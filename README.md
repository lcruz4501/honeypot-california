# Honeypot: California Cyber Traffic Observation

## Overview

This project documents the deployment of a honeypot to monitor and analyze unsolicited network traffic targeting a public IP address located in California.

The honeypot was used to:
- Log attempted connections from suspicious IPs
- Identify scanning behavior and attack types
- Understand common vectors targeting unused infrastructure

## Tools Used

- Honeypot platform (e.g., Cowrie or T-Pot)
- Cloud hosting (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS)
- Logging and IP intelligence tools

## Purpose

This was my first hands-on cybersecurity project. It gave me early insight into attacker behavior and helped me develop an understanding of:
- Network monitoring
- Threat intelligence basics
- Real-world traffic analysis

Though simple, it was a key stepping stone into my cybersecurity learning journey.
